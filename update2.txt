\subsubsection{The impact of the MID backtracking correction}
In order to understand if the corrected backtracking algorithm for mismatches, deletions, and insertions
does an impact on the number of found real data search pattern matches. Statistical observations are 
necessary, since it is a matter of specific pattern occurences in genomic data.\\
\\
Since the domain specific language used in \scm and \sfm creates a lot of oppertunities for different 
patterns using mismatches, deletions, and insertions backtracking. The tests are designed to create 
a close to exhaustive picture of the different \pu combinations possible, with different amounts of 
insertions, and deletions.

\caption{Tests where backtracking of mismatches, deletions and insertions are present. Showing the
percentage increase in number of matches found when the formentioned error in \scm is corrected as done
in \sfm. The columns "ScanFM" and "Scan\_for\_matches" show the respective number of matches found when
the patterns shown are executed. The tests are performed on chr10.fa}
\end{table}

From the tests it can be seen that the number of matches found in every single test is greater for \sfm,
than \scm. In some cases, even without the use of a large number of deletions, and insertions, the number
of matches found by \sfm is significantly larger. \\
\\
When changing the number of deletions, and insertions, there are cases for \scm where there are les matches
with an increase in deletions, and insertions. This confirms the extent of the problem, and the importance
of the correction, because it shouldn't be possible. Given a larger margin for mutations only a larger number
of matches should become visible, never fewer.\\
\\
Making the distance between the backtracking and the next sequence needed to be found flexible, seems
to make the error in \scm less pronounced.
